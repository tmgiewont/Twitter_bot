# Twitter_bot
This is an old project that I made in highschool during the 2016 election. The idea was to make a twitter bot that would automatically retweet and tweet politcally right leaning tweets
This project was made awhile ago and at the time of writing I was just learning how to code in Python so a lot of the code style is not done best to my current ability.
When I have more free time I plan to revist this project for the upcoming election and possibly make a bot that would accomplish the same idea but for politically left leaning tweets
